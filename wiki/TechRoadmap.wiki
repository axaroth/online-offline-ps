= Incoming features =

  * management of multi-manuals

  * simple mash-up support

  * MacOS portable version

= What's next? =

  * Javascript framework (see below)

  * Support for Google Sites

The plan is to refactor the code to have a javascript web application framework; 
In this way we can simplify the deployment code having only javascript and html on the frontend and a simple web service to provide the data coming from the backoffice.
