#summary OOPS Features.

Created for field usage

 _"Taking into account that internet connection in the field can be a challenge, with sometimes limited internet connectivity, the LOG can be used in online or offline mode. The user can download the LOG onto a computer, USB or other storage device and at which point all information can be searched and browsed in the same manner- offline or online. When updating the latest revisions of the LOG, only the revised parts of the LOG will be downloaded."_
